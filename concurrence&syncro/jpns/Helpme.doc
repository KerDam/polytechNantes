HelpFile for PNS - The Petri Net Simulator, Java Version!


This is a small summary of the possiiblities PNS gives you.
For additional information about petri nets, their functions
and elements please look in secondary literature (best in
books about graph theory or special petri net workouts).



Starting...

After unzipping the program archive, you can run it as an applet or as an application.
As applet:
    You can use either your favorite, java-enabled WWW-Browser by accessing the
    JPNS.HTML file or you can use the appletviewer that comes with the JDK with the
    command "appletviewer jpns.html". You may have to correct the path given in the
    HTML-file to give access to your installation path.
    Of course you can write your own Web-page.
    The only thing you have to do is to adress the JPNSAPPLET.CLASS file in nearly the
    same way as in the JPNS.HTML file.
    RESTRICTIONS: As an applet, the program in NOT able to read or write to the
                  local disk. Therefore YOU CAN NOT LOAD OR SAVE FILES.
                  This is a restriction of your browser! The appletviewer may
                  allow some disk access, but it is a whole lot better to run
                  the program as application...

As application:
    Type the command "java jpns" in the directory in wich you installed jPNS.
    Your java interpreter may have some other name (e.g. "javapm" in OS/2), but
    it is all the same way.
    Running as an application, the program as its full funtionality!



THE COMMANDS of PNS are:

    Menu FILE :
    -----------

        NEW     clears the whole drawing
        ---

        Load    opens a dialog to load a new petri net from a PNS-File.
        ----    The drawings so far will be overwritten.

        Save    will save the current drawing into a specified PNS-File.
        ----    When selected first in a new drawing, it opens a dialog to
                specifiy the name of the file.

        Save As opens a dialog to save the current drawing into a PNS-File.
        ------- There will be a security question before overwriting a existing
                file.

        Quit    quits PNS.
        ----


    Menu SETTINGS :
    ---------------

        The first two items, wich are "Parallel" and "Sequentiell", specify
        the mode that is used when running the current petri net. You have
        the following choices:

        Parallel Random     All transitions fire parallel. When there are two
        ---------------     transitions that are connected with the same node
                            and this node has only one token left, the activating
                            will be chosen by random.

        Parallel Manual     Same as above, but you will be asked wich transition
        ---------------     to be activated.

        Sequentiell Random  All transitions fire after another. Wich one is chosen
        ------------------  by random.

        Sequentiell Manual  Same as above, but are in comlete control of the
        ------------------  firing.

        The other two items in this menu are useful for the graphical output.
        If "Options" is chosen, a dialog is opened, where you can choose the "Show" option
        (colorize firing transition during running a petri net) and selct the delay time between each step.
        The "Painting" item will give you the possibility to chose between a
        colored output and a black-white one (useful for printing).


    Menu HELP :
    -----------

        About       Brings up a window containing informations about the program.
        -----

        Commands    Will show you this helpfile.
        --------


Now for the graphical icons:

From left to right, the icons symbolize

        "Release"   -   Deactivate the current draw mode. Here you can move all
                        components of the petri net with the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON(LMB).

        "Add Node"  -   In this mode you can place nodes with the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
                        The RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON(RMB) is for moving all components.

        "Add Transition     -   In this mode you can place nodes with
                                the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
                                The RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON is for moving all components.

        "Add Edge"  -   good for drawing edges by clicking with the LMB.
                        When clicking again on a corresponding component, the edge
                        will be drawn. Otherwise no edge will be placed or, if
                        clicking on the background, you can give the edge additional
                        vertices.

        "Add Token" -   LMB for adding tokens to a node.
                        RMB for subtracting tokens from a node.

        "Edit"      -   LMB opens the corresponding dialog for the selected component.
                        Here you can enter names, conditions etc.

        "Delete"    -   LMB deletes the selected component with all adjacent edges.

        "Save"      -   Same as menu item "Save".

        "Memorize"  -   Here you can memorize the current petri net. With the...

        "Draw Memorized"    -   ...button you can draw the memorized petri net.

        "Step"      -   Initiates the current running mode and makes the petri net
                        going on.

        "Single Step"       -   Same as Step, but invokes only one single step with
                                each press.


The status line informs you of your current actions, the current running mode
and the current painting mode and the step count.


Now feel free to try on your own....



...but first the DISCLAIMER:

You may may use this software for free. No payment will be required.
If you want to copy this program to someone, do it! But if you do so, please
don't rearrange or change the program package. Don't remove files nor make some
additions. You may take the source code and make some improvements / additions
for your own use, but don't distribute them without contacting us first.
It is no good to have X versions of Y persons lying around the net.
And after all, it is our program, don't you think?!

If you want to complete your shareware collection cd-rom with this program,
that is quite all right. But only with the restrictions above a for a price
that is corresponding to your expanses, not for profit!

If you have some extensions, additions or some good idea, please contact us,
so we can see, what we can do.

If you have found a bug, you may keep it and feed it.
OK, quite a joke. If there is a real bug (and NOT a problem with some JDK versions),
then you are of course encouraged to tell us about it. We don't promise anything,
but there may be some way to eliminate it.



ONE LAST THING:

There are some things we couldn't get around to implementate them in the program
that where in the C version:

    One thing was the break conditions for transitions.
    Second, the option "Stop after fire" isn't functionating yet.

If there is a need for these funtions please contact us.

The Load/Save-Routines should be able to read / write the PNS-Files of the old
program. Especially loading shouldn't be a problem. Because of the different
architecture of the two programs and the enormous possibilities of petri nets,
we can not garantee for a 100% compatibility.

If you experience problems with the dialogs not coming up, especially on
Solaris computers in cooperation with X-Terminals, sorry, that seems to be a
problem of Java and its implementation with Motif (or so we think). If someone
has some better explication, please tell us.



TESTING:

... was done with JDK 1.0 on the following systems

    Windows 95
    Windows NT 4.0
    OS/2 Warp 3.0 and 4.0
    Solaris
